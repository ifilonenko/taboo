Taboo - Responsive, web-based game
=========

I recently spent a week at my grandmother's house, where there is a rather inconvenient ratio of fun games to cousins. I thought taboo would be a fun game, but we didn't own it, and none of the online implementations seemed to match our needs. So I decided to write my own! 


###Features###

 * 1 minute round-time
 * Keeps track of score
 * Pseudo-random, pseudo-intelligent algorithm for next card which doesn't repeat cards
 * Simple UI
 * Adding new cards is a breeze!
 * Unlimited (until you run out of cards) fun!


###Database###

All cards are stored in a mySQL database, the structure of which is saved in `database.sql`
